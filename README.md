# Statistics-Analysis-With-Hypothesis-Testing-And-Regression-Analysis
# Overview
In the competitive taxi booking industry, optimizing revenue is crucial for sustained success and driver satisfaction. This project aims to leverage data-driven approaches to enhance income streams for taxi drivers, prioritizing their financial well-being. The study explores the potential influence of payment methods on fare pricing by examining the correlation between different payment types and the amount charged for fares.

# Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to conduct an A/B test to investigate the association between the total fare and the payment method in Python. Through hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics, valuable insights will be extracted to aid taxi drivers in maximizing cash earnings. Specifically, the focus is on determining whether there exists a significant disparity in fares between customers paying with credit cards and those paying with cash.

# Methodology
Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing information on fares, payment methods, and other relevant variables.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and outliers if any.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory analysis to gain insights into the distribution of fares across different payment methods.
Hypothesis Testing: Formulate hypotheses and perform statistical tests (e.g., t-test) to assess the significance of differences in fare amounts based on payment method.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics and visualizations to present findings effectively.
Interpretation: Interpret the results of the analysis and draw actionable insights for taxi drivers.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn)
Files Included
data.csv: Sample dataset containing relevant information for analysis.
Taxi_Revenue_Optimization.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization.
